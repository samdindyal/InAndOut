# InAndOut

In order to learn iOS development I have decided to remake old assignments from the first time I learned programming. The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate user input and output. This application stores user input containing a name, address, city and postal code using a simple UINavigationController interface. The information is stored locally and is not persistent.
